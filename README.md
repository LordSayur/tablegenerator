# HTML Table Code Generator

This is a simple HTML Table Code Generator.

## The Story

Several times when I was building up a simple HTML table for clients, I am forced to write up a lot of ```<tr>```'s and ```<td>```'s. Especially when they have a lot of content to fill in to different cells, rows and columns. I think everyone who writes HTML tables know how I feel about it. So I decided to write up a simple web application that generates the rows and columns and I'll fill in the content later.

## Pipeline

May find that the web application is available on [https://qoyyuum.github.io/tablegenerator/](https://qoyyuum.github.io/tablegenerator/) and for future development, any new feature or suggestion will be tracked by ["Issues"](https://github.com/Qoyyuum/tablegenerator/issues/) of this repo.
