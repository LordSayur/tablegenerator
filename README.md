# HTML Table Code Generator

This is a simple HTML Table Code Generator.

## The Story

Several times when I was building up a simple HTML table for clients, I am forced to write up a lot of <tr>'s and <td>'s. Especially when they have a lot of content to fill in to different cells, rows and columns. I think everyone who writes HTML tables know how I feel about it. So I decided to write up a simple web application that generates the rows and columns and I'll fill in the content later.

## Pipeline

A few things to add into this webapp:

* Add Editor like ability to each table cell for anyone to add images, bold, italic, underline, strikethrough, etc.
* Add table styling base on CSS Framework like Twitter Bootstrap, Foundation 4, Skeleton, etc.
